The program takes 3 arguments. Should less than 3 arguments be provided, a helpful error message should be displayed.

The first argument should a string of the form:

	name:author:width:height:startcol:startrow:cells

where all the fields are seperated by colons. Fields name and author are strings; width, height, startcol and startrow are all positive integers specifying the size of the grid and starting position of the pattern provided by cells.

Cells is a pattern of 0s and 1 to signify the initial pattern. Adjacent numbers represent adjacent columns of cells and spaces are used to separate the rows.

The second argument should be an integer that specifies the number of generations of the board to be encoded into audio.

The third argument should be the filename of the output, a .wav file.

A world must be created based on the entered information. That world should be able to update itself using the rules of the Game of Life.

For each generation, each cell in the world will have its own timeslot. Each cell will have a frequency and an amplitude assigned to it by the algorithm specified below. When all the sounds have been appended, the file should be written to disk.

To create a rough, simple 12 bar-blues (see online), for dead cells, the row index will be taken modulo 12, each chord will have 3 notes, so the cell index can be taken modulo 3.
For alive cells, the tonic will be played louder than the dead cells at in an actave above all of them.
